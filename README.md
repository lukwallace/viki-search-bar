# viki-search-bar

> Note: CSS borrowed heavily from [here](http://cssdeck.com/labs/search-box-with-suggestions-dropdown)

Assumptions made on problem scope: In the interest of getting a quick prototype out, I'm using a relatively new tag - datalist. It handles of lot of the work and the specs did not mention not being able to use it. However, it should be noted that because it is fairly new,[it is not supported on older browsers.](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_datalist.asp). Other disadvantages are that it doesn't do well when you're interested in tweaking its' minute details. 

That being said, building it from ground up would still be an interesting problem. But will involve a series of questions to which I am not entirely sure if you guys have the time for me to ask? For instance, what (if any) additional information might be we be interested in displaying in terms of the search suggestions. Or the even bigger picture, who will you (hypothetically) have use the search bar? What are they searching for? -- and so on.

As always feedback on my design choices would be awesome, but not expected as it's not typically the norm with coding challenges. I'm always of courese open to going back and adding more on request. Thanks for having me!
